# IOT-smart-street-light
An IOT smart lighting system using LDR, IR and nodeMCU. 
We use LDR for brightness value from the surrounding,
IR for motion detection, and nodemcu because it is an open source platform based on ESP8266 which can connect objects and let data transfer using the Wi-Fi protocol.
